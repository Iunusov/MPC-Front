Web GUI for the <b>Media Player Classic</b> (<b>MPC</b>, command-line utility), can be used with <b>Icecast2</b> and <b>Music Player Daemon (MPD)</b> for easy radio stream management (changing tracks, etc).

Before using, you must have installed and configured <b>mpc</b> command-line utility.

Do not forget to change a password in the <b>config.php</b> (see <b>$CONFIG["user"]</b> and <b>$CONFIG["pass"])</b>.

NOTE: it's just a prototype (I want to control my radio from the sofa using a tablet=)))
