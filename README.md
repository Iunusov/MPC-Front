Web GUI for the Media Player Classic (MPC, command-line utility), can be used with Icecast2 and Music Player Daemon (MPD) for easy radio stream management (changing tracks, etc).

Before using, you must have installed and configured mpc command-line utility.

Do not forget to change a password in the config.php (see $CONFIG["user"] and $CONFIG["pass"]).

NOTE: it's just a prototype (I want to control my radio from the sofa using a tablet=)))
